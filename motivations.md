I want out of warehousing / hate having to travel long distances away from major cities
Always thought that i'd like this kind of stuff
always had an itch for creating things in a computer, rather than working with my hands
I think the team atmosphere / component of all of this is underrated. Looking forward to being a leader and a teammate and both at times
